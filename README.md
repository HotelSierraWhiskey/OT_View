# OT View

## What is this?

OT View is a calendar tool for Occasional Teachers who use SmartFind Express (SFE) to manage their schedule. SFE is a good management tool, but it does not provide its users with a calendar view. Manually transferring substitute jobs from SFE into a calendar is time consuming and error prone. OT View connects to your SFE account via a headless webdriver and pulls your schedule into a friendly calendar. OT View will query SFE periodically to keep your schedule up to date.
