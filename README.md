# OT View

## What is this?

OT View is a calendar tool for Occasional Teachers who use SmartFind Express (SFE) to manage their schedule. SFE is a good management tool, but its calendar display is limited and does not update live. OT View uses selenium to connect to your SFE account and pulls your schedule into its calendar periodically. OT View also includes a number of features that SFE does not, such as financial tracking, schedule exporting, highlighting, and annotations.
